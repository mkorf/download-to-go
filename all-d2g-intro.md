# Introduction

The Predictive Content Delivery (PCD) SDK allows users to download videos intelligetntly to mobile devices. Users initiate downloads by browsing your video catalog and selecting the content to watch. 

A sophisticated Download Manager checks the battery, device storage, network, and other variables to make sure that the video transfer will succeed. Errors are thrown if the video transfer fails. 

Downloads continue whether the app is active in the foreground, running in the background, or entirely closed. In addition, the SDK acts as a data cache, providing access to content along with its current download state. 

## Audience

This document is for developers implementing the PCD SDK; deep knowledge of Android and/or iOS is assumed.
